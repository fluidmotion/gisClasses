### GIS 101
Recently (2015), Arkansas passed a bill requiring all public and charter schools to offer computer science courses (http://governor.arkansas.gov/promises/computer-science/ and http://www.wired.com/2015/03/arkansas-computer-science/). The move underscores the importance of learning computing concepts.

These files represent a short course on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) designed for us homeschoolers. This course introduces (very) basic computer concepts (OS, directory structures, file types) - and moves (primarily) into GIS terms, methods, and software.
