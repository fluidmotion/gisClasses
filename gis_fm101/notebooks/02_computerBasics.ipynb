    "- It can be much simpler to find data or projects you have if you start with some type of file system logic. you may have a master directory with your username. Within that, you might have directories for downloads, scripts, notes, generic GIS data, and projects. Within a project directory - you may again have multiple directories of specific gis data, documentation, project-specific scripts, etc. Whatever structure you choose, give it some thought - almost anything is better than a single directory full of thousands of files from different topics all mixed together."
