Because the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is somewhat \"egg-shaped,\" the shape is approximated (with spheroids and ellipsoids) to represent actual shape of the earth. These approximations do match well everywhere, therefore, different datums may be used in different locations on the planet.\n",

However, for specific locations, WGS84 may include unwanted error. So, other local datums have be used instead. The local North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27, in dashed red line) more closely fits the earth's surface in the upper-left quadrant of the earth's cross-section. NAD27 only fits this quadrant, so to use it in another part of the earth will result in errors. For mapping North America, in order to obtain the most accurate locations and measurements, NAD27 or NAD83/91 are used."
