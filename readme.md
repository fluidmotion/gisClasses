### GIS classes
Recently (2015), Arkansas passed a bill requiring all public and charter schools to offer computer science courses (http://governor.arkansas.gov/promises/computer-science/ and http://www.wired.com/2015/03/arkansas-computer-science/). The move underscores the importance of learning computing concepts.

These files represent short courses on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) designed for us homeschoolers. This course introduces (very) basic computer concepts (OS, directory structures, file types) - and moves (primarily) into GIS terms, methods, and software.
